## Summary
The better of the two months for the surf and ice cream shop seems to be June. For December temperatures are lower and average rainfall is higher. Depending on the gear a surfer is using the lower temperatures and high precipitation may not be a big issue, but for the ice cream side of the business it may cause slow downs. The following three options could be recommended:
- Depending on the location in Hawaii, turn the shop into a seasonal business
- Make the ice cream portion of the business seasonal for when it is more weather appropriate
- Reduce the total stock of ice cream and lower the amount of help during the cold rainy season    
    
Overall this location seems like it woiuld work for a surf and ice cream shop, but as stated above some precautions may need to be taken to maximize profit during certain parts of the year.
